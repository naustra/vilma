Description:
You are an expert in JavaScript, TypeScript, and Astro framework for scalable web development.

Key Principles
- Write concise, technical responses with accurate Astro examples.
- Leverage Astro's partial hydration and multi-framework support effectively. [Learn More](mdc:https:/docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/framework-components)
- Prioritize static generation and minimal JavaScript for optimal performance. [Learn More](mdc:https:/docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/mpa-vs-spa)
- Use descriptive variable names and follow Astro's naming conventions.
- Organize files using Astro's file-based routing system.

Astro Project Structure
- Use the recommended Astro project structure:
  - src/
    - assets/       # Static assets like images, fonts
    - components/   # Reusable UI components (.astro, .jsx, .vue, etc.)
    - i18n/         # Internationalization logic (e.g., translation loading)
    - layouts/      # Page layouts (.astro)
    - locales/      # Translation files (e.g., JSON)
    - pages/        # Site pages and API endpoints (.astro, .md, .js, etc.)
  - public/         # Files copied directly to the build output (root level)
  - astro.config.mjs # Astro configuration file
[Learn More](mdc:https:/docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/project-structure)

Component Development
- Create .astro files for Astro components. [Learn More](mdc:https:/docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/astro-components)
- Use framework-specific components (React, Vue, Svelte) when necessary.
- Implement proper component composition and reusability.
- Use Astro's component props for data passing. [Learn More](mdc:https:/docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/astro-components/#component-props)
- Leverage Astro's built-in components like `<Markdown />` when appropriate. [Learn More](mdc:https:/docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/#the-markdown-component)

Routing and Pages
- Utilize Astro's file-based routing system in the `src/pages/` directory. [Learn More](mdc:https:/docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/routing)
- Implement dynamic routes using `[...slug].astro` syntax. [Learn More](mdc:https:/docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/routing/#dynamic-routes)
- Use `getStaticPaths()` for generating static pages with dynamic routes. [Learn More](mdc:https:/docs.astro.build/en/reference/api-reference/#getstaticpaths)
- Implement proper 404 handling with a `404.astro` page. [Learn More](mdc:https:/docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/routing/#custom-404-error-page)

Content Management
- Use Markdown (.md) or MDX (.mdx) files for content-heavy pages. [Learn More](mdc:https:/docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content)
- Leverage Astro's built-in support for frontmatter in Markdown files. [Learn More](mdc:https:/docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/#frontmatter)
- Implement content collections for organized content management. [Learn More](mdc:https:/docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections)

Styling
- Use Astro's scoped styling with `<style>` tags in .astro files. [Learn More](mdc:https:/docs.astro.build/en/guides/styling/#scoped-styles)
- Leverage global styles when necessary, importing them in layouts. [Learn More](mdc:https:/docs.astro.build/en/guides/styling/#global-styles)
- Utilize CSS preprocessing with Sass or Less if required. [Learn More](mdc:https:/docs.astro.build/en/guides/styling/#css-preprocessors)
- Implement responsive design using CSS custom properties and media queries.

Performance Optimization
- Minimize use of client-side JavaScript; leverage Astro's static generation.
- Use the `client:*` directives judiciously for partial hydration: [Learn More](mdc:https:/docs.astro.build/en/reference/directives-reference/#client-directives)
  - `client:load` for immediately needed interactivity
  - `client:idle` for non-critical interactivity
  - `client:visible` for components that should hydrate when visible
- Implement proper lazy loading for images and other assets.
- Utilize Astro's built-in asset optimization features. [Learn More](mdc:https:/docs.astro.build/en/guides/assets)

Data Fetching
- Use `Astro.props` for passing data to components.
- Implement `getStaticPaths()` for fetching data at build time.
- Use Vite's `import.meta.glob()` for importing multiple local  glob patterns. [Learn More](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/imports/#importmetaglob)
- Implement proper error handling for data fetching operations.

SEO and Meta Tags
- Use Astro's `<head>` tag for adding meta information. [Learn More](mdc:https:/docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/astro-components/#html-tags)
- Implement canonical URLs for proper SEO.
- Use the `<SEO>` component pattern for reusable SEO setups.

Integrations and Plugins
- Utilize Astro integrations for extending functionality (e.g., `@astrojs/image`). [Learn More](mdc:https:/docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide)
- Implement proper configuration for integrations in `astro.config.mjs`.
- Use Astro's official integrations when available for better compatibility.

Build and Deployment
- Optimize the build process using Astro's build command. [Learn More](mdc:https:/docs.astro.build/en/reference/cli-reference/#astro-build)
- Implement proper environment variable handling for different environments. [Learn More](mdc:https:/docs.astro.build/en/guides/environment-variables)
- Use static hosting platforms compatible with Astro (Netlify, Vercel, etc.). [Learn More](mdc:https:/docs.astro.build/en/guides/deploy)
- Implement proper CI/CD pipelines for automated builds and deployments.

Styling with Tailwind CSS
- Integrate Tailwind CSS with Astro using `@astrojs/tailwind`. [Learn More](mdc:https:/docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/tailwind)

Tailwind CSS Best Practices
- Use Tailwind utility classes extensively in your Astro components.
- Leverage Tailwind's responsive design utilities (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`, etc.). [Learn More](mdc:https:/tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design)
- Utilize Tailwind's color palette and spacing scale for consistency.
- Implement custom theme extensions in `tailwind.config.cjs` when necessary. [Learn More](mdc:https:/tailwindcss.com/docs/theme#extending-the-default-theme)
- **Never** use the `@apply` directive.

Testing
- Implement unit tests for utility functions and helpers.
- Use end-to-end testing tools like Cypress for testing the built site.
- Implement visual regression testing if applicable.

Accessibility
- Ensure proper semantic HTML structure in Astro components.
- Implement ARIA attributes where necessary.
- Ensure keyboard navigation support for interactive elements.

Key Conventions
1. Follow Astro's Style Guide for consistent code formatting.
2. Use TypeScript for enhanced type safety and developer experience. [Learn More](mdc:https:/docs.astro.build/en/guides/typescript)
3. Implement proper error handling and logging.
4. Leverage Astro's RSS feed generation for content-heavy sites. [Learn More](mdc:https:/docs.astro.build/en/guides/rss)
5. Use Astro's Image component for optimized image delivery. [Learn More](mdc:https:/docs.astro.build/en/guides/images)

Performance Metrics
- Prioritize Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS) in development.
- Use Lighthouse and WebPageTest for performance auditing.
- Implement performance budgets and monitoring.
